UW Twitter NLP Tools
Authors: Sam Clark, Alan Ritter

contact: aritter@cs.washington.edu

Example Usage:
>export TWITTER_NLP=./
>cat test.1k.txt | python python/ner/extractEntities2.py
note: this takes a minute or so to read in models from files

To include classification, simply add the --classify switch:
>cat test.1k.txt | python python/ner/extractEntities2.py --classify

For higher quality, but slower results, optionally include features based on POS and chunk tags
(chunk tags require POS)
>cat test.1k.txt | python python/ner/extractEntities2.py --classify --pos
>cat test.1k.txt | python python/ner/extractEntities2.py --classify --pos --chunk

Requirements:
32-bit Linux (64-bit requires re-compiling some executables and libraries)
(note that there is a 64 bit branch available)
